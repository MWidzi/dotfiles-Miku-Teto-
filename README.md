run 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/MWidzi/dotfiles-Miku-Teto/ ~/.config
```
for the scripts to run correctly

Most of the project relies on symlinks - ensure that none of the programs above except for vesktop have folders in .config and create a symlink for every folder in the cloned repo except for firefox and Discord - for Discord run
```sh
rm -rf ~/.config/vesktop/themes ~/.config/vesktop/settings ~/.config/vesktop/settings.json
cp -r ~/.config/Discord/* ~/.config/vesktop
```
> [!WARNING]
> This will remove any previous settings you had so back that up before you run

for firefox refer to the .txt note in firefox folder

> I might make a install script later on if i feel like it, for now it's manual install only

after you've done everything restart your session and if something isn't working reboot the system, should be fine
